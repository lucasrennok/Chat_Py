# Chat

Versions of a chat in python.

## V1
Simple, server receive and client send and after client receive and server send.

To use: *python simple_client.py* or *python simple_server.py*, it depends if you want to host or not.
And if you want to be the first to send a mesage.

## V2
The same as the first version, but there is the "online" class that can do all the process of receiving and sending a mesage.

To use: *python main.py* and you decide if you want to be the server or the client.

## V3
I pretend to use threads to receive and send mesages at the same time...
